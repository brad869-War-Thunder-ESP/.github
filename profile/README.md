# War Thunder ESP – Visual Domination in Every Battle 🧠🔍

Tired of getting one-tapped by someone you never even saw? Whether it’s a tank hidden in the bushes or a jet diving in from the stratosphere, War Thunder’s standard visibility just doesn’t cut it. That’s where the **ESP cheat** comes in – a visual overlay system that lets you **see enemies at all times**, no matter where they hide.

This isn’t just some wallhack. This is full **Enhanced Sensory Perception (ESP)** for **tanks, aircraft, and naval vessels**, all rendered clearly on your screen like a built-in UAV system. Get that *sixth sense* advantage and wipe out squads before they can blink.

## 🔎 What is War Thunder ESP?

ESP stands for Enhanced Sensory Perception – a cheat that reveals in-game objects by drawing overlays directly onto your screen. For War Thunder, this cheat reveals:

* 🔺 Enemy positions at all times
* 🧠 Vehicle names, types & ranks
* ❤️ Health bars and damage indicators
* 🎯 Crew modules, ammo racks, engines
* 🗿 Line of sight boxes, distance tags
* 🚩 Nation & tier identifiers

It’s like having permanent x-ray vision—through smoke, hills, walls, and camouflage.
